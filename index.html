                            <p>The Great Mother - that from which all is born; a spaciousness that is the essence of vitality. A potency of potential. </p>

                            <p>Nothing that is is disconnected from this. Even in the sense of disconnection, there is connectivity. It is always present. It is all there is. </p>

                            <p>We can use it any way we want, yet there is a path. </p>

                            <p>Even if one feels they have fallen off the path, where could one possibly fall? Any consequences that arise from one’s traversing are only natural and are indications of the nature of the path itself. </p>

                            <p>Because it is so broad and spacious, and we can use it however we want, the path appears to become narrower and narrower. This narrowing path is a revelation of quality.</p>

                            <p>There was never any manual. Every mistake carries with it success. Only by trial and error have we gotten this far.</p>

                            <p>Each life is a means of revealing the path. The path reveals itself, whether life is lived on or off the path.</p>

                            <p>Even so, better to do one’s best to journey along the path: what better way to honor all those who came before us?</p>

                            <p>Sweet neutrality. Full acceptance, of what enters within one's experience and circumstance.</p>

                            <p>Fully open eyes to see. Eyes not blinded by planks. Compassionate eyes. Eyes that are adept at seeing to the heart of the matter.</p>

                            <p>An open, clear heart. One that responds and puts our thinking to necessary tasks. </p>

                            <p>The heart is the sacred chamber from which true communication arises. The voice that speaks to what has entered emerges for all ears to hear, even the ones attached  to the same body as the vocal cords. </p>

                            <p>With a clear heart, there are no longer saints, no longer sinners. It's a position of responsiveness and responsibility. Not one of judgment. There is praise, but never condemnation. </p>

                            <p>This responsiveness occurs without mental initiation. This responsiveness initiates proper movement in body and mind and spirit. </p>

                            <p>This responsiveness has at its center stillness. Thus it always moves a situation towards resolution. </p>

                            <p>Mostly nothing is added, unless that addition is one that ultimately leads to subtraction. A strategic position, yet without motivation.</p>

                            <p>There is always more to subtract, than there is to add.</p>

                            <p>This position of neutrality leaves one untouchable and unconsumed, yet fully immersed.</p>

                            <p>One is like a duck floating and swimming and diving in water. Even when fully submerged one remains dry. </p>

                            <p>“It is older than God” - Is this because the idea of God requires the human soil from which it can emerge? </p>

                            <p>The very presence of this echo describes a vastness within the human territory that in some way can encapsulate that which is beyond vastness so that it can echo within. </p>

                            <p>Is this echo a distraction? An idol?</p>

                            <p>I look back and see a sort of subtle devastation. </p>

                            <p>My path through life has been driven by boisterous, ever hungrier desires. Desires for recognition have welcomed in envy, greed, and lust. Desires for beauty and possessions have welcomed in vanity and slothfulness. </p>

                            <p>I have chased the unattainable and my body and its pain and my mind with its quirky patterns testify to the results of such a chase.</p>

                            <p>Yet it is not too late. </p>

                            <p>There is time. </p>

                            <p>There is no quick fix scheme to this process of healing. Desiring one is only another mind form seeking for a result. </p>

                            <p>No, the resolution is simplicity. </p>

                            <p>It’s more of a divestment than an investment. Yet, divesting from the investments of what is valueless is an investment into what is truly valuable. </p>

                            <p>It’s a movement towards simplicity, gently. </p>

                            <p>It is observation and stillness. </p>

                            <p>Allowing the dust to settle and clarity to arise. </p>

                            <p>It is an act of trust and faith in the process within which I am.</p>

                            <p>It is a tending to my garden. But instead of me planting, it’s more so a matter of my uprooting what I’ve planted in order to make room for what would and could grow.</p>

                            <p>In the space created, the seeds of character are sown and nurtured. </p>

                            <p>The best teacher is experience. The next best teacher is the one we observe, the one who does without explaining. We observe, then some process beyond our sense of “I” recognizes. </p>
                            <p>Experience requires no words. Experience comes through a willingness to be abandoned within the wild moment and to do what the moment and circumstance requires. Nothing more, nothing less. And if more or less, then we experience the waste or the poverty. </p>
                            <p>Experience cannot be possessed. That which believes it possesses experience will pass away in time. That which desires possession is the cage and we are the ones possessed. </p>
                            <p>The one who is experienced does not cling to the experience, but rather has built up enough real experience to trust in the underlying process of experience. That what needs to be known will arise when it needs to be known. And if what needs to be known is not available to arise, then that in and of itself is another experience that is allowed to be experienced and pass through. </p>
                            <p>Experiences pass through us. The more we allow this to occur, the lighter we become. We learn that not much is needed to travel, and what is truly needed is weightless. </p>
                            <p>It is when we cling to the knowledge of our experiences, and worse so when we cling to knowledge unrooted from experience, that we become heavy and rigid. Here is where rigor mortis of the spirit begins to set in. </p>
                            <p>True experience cannot be possessed. True experience can only move through us. If we allow it to do so, we will be revealed. </p>

                            <p>Balance in between. We live in this space between the names and the unnamed. We are the originators of the named, but we ourselves originate from the unnamed. The named is born out of us, yet we are born out of that which is beyond words. We share with this Source the capacity for creation. </p>
                            <p>Yet this power comes with risk. The risk is disconnection from the nature of the Source, from the its subtle wonder. </p>
                            <p>Our ability to name is also an ability to cage ourselves. This encagement is agitating to our spirit, for the spirit's nature is uncontainable.</p>
                            <p>Our words, concepts, and ideas, and our identification with these, is like the hand that tries to grasp water. The water will not cooperate, and even that which does seem to cling to the hand is lost to evaporation. The being that is lost within the named will be frustrated by this. The one who is not lost sees it as it is. Mysterious, wondrous.</p>
                            <p>It is best to be rooted in that which is nameless. What is nameless is bountiful and ever-present. What is named is quick to become idolized yet what is contained within the name is empty space. </p>
                            <p>This is only a problem when we aren't used to being rooted in the bounty that is emptiness. </p>

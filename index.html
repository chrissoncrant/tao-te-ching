                            <p>The best teacher is experience. The next best teacher is the one we observe, the one who does without explaining. We observe, then some process beyond our sense of “I” recognizes. </p>
                            <p>Experience requires no words. Experience comes through a willingness to be abandoned within the wild moment and to do what the moment and circumstance requires. Nothing more, nothing less. And if more or less, then we experience the waste or the poverty. </p>
                            <p>Experience cannot be possessed. That which believes it possesses experience will pass away in time. That which desires possession is the cage and we are the ones possessed. </p>
                            <p>The one who is experienced does not cling to the experience, but rather has built up enough real experience to trust in the underlying process of experience. That what needs to be known will arise when it needs to be known. And if what needs to be known is not available to arise, then that in and of itself is another experience that is allowed to be experienced and pass through. </p>
                            <p>Experiences pass through us. The more we allow this to occur, the lighter we become. We learn that not much is needed to travel, and what is truly needed is weightless. </p>
                            <p>It is when we cling to the knowledge of our experiences, and worse so when we cling to knowledge unrooted from experience, that we become heavy and rigid. Here is where rigor mortis of the spirit begins to set in. </p>
                            <p>True experience cannot be possessed. True experience can only move through us. If we allow it to do so, we will be revealed. </p>

                            <p>Balance in between. We live in this space between the names and the unnamed. We are the originators of the named, but we ourselves originate from the unnamed. The named is born out of us, yet we are born out of that which is beyond words. We share with this Source the capacity for creation. </p>
                            <p>Yet this power comes with risk. The risk is disconnection from the nature of the Source, from the its subtle wonder. </p>
                            <p>Our ability to name is also an ability to cage ourselves. This encagement is agitating to our spirit, for the spirit's nature is uncontainable.</p>
                            <p>Our words, concepts, and ideas, and our identification with these, is like the hand that tries to grasp water. The water will not cooperate, and even that which does seem to cling to the hand is lost to evaporation. The being that is lost within the named will be frustrated by this. The one who is not lost sees it as it is. Mysterious, wondrous.</p>
                            <p>It is best to be rooted in that which is nameless. What is nameless is bountiful and ever-present. What is named is quick to become idolized yet what is contained within the name is empty space. </p>
                            <p>This is only a problem when we aren't used to being rooted in the bounty that is emptiness. </p>

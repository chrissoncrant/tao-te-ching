                            <p>Clinging to my ideas, I become like a house with its windows and doors shut to the outside. </p>

                            <p>Dust, mold, stagnant air, skittering bugs, cobwebs. Glowing television into sightless zombie eyes.</p>
                            
                            <p>The wind blows, and all I hear are the creaks and moans of my rigidity, my rigor mortis. All I feel is stale air weighing heavy upon my pale skin. </p>
                            
                            <p>The rain falls, and the kisses of each droplet can't find me. The vitalizing coolness is locked out.</p>
                            
                            <p>The sun rises and sets, and the beauty of each misses my sight. Stale electric LEDs numb me to natural cycles. </p>
                            
                            <p>The moon and stars shine above, and their celestial wonder cannot reach me. Their expanse cannot break through my willed imprisonment.</p>
                            
                            <p>Drop the ideas, and the doors and windows open. Natural light shines through. Refreshing air enters in. The outside beckons me into my true inside. </p>

                            <p>This chapter is challenging in its directness. My inner programming, with its values and imperatives, is rooted in a “go forth and conquer” mentality—a sense of having to earn my living. </p>

                            <p>There is a sweetness in the challenge. It's a redirect. The sweetness points toward that within that requires no justification through effort. It draws attention to that within which was unearned.</p>
                            
                            <p>On one side, there is fear and confusion that arises from contact with this teaching. It's a sense of having the ground of habit pulled out from under my feet - a Jenga tower in the midst of collapse. </p>
                            
                            <p>On the other side is a sense of peace and curiosity. What will happen if this Jenga tower collapses? There is a sense of energy and also stillness. What actions arise from this position? Who initiates these actions?</p>
                            
                            <p>We are moved by one side or the other. One side is moved by fear; the other is moved by that which moves everything. The only necessary action is to cease unnecessary actions.</p>

                            <p>Unnecessary layers of separation exist between us humans and reality. These layers insulate us, but from what? Are these layers based on fear? It seems so. What is it that fears, though?</p>

                            <p>There is a natural fear. This fear keeps us aware, alive, present, humble, and capable of gratitude. This fear doesn't add layers to reality but keeps us connected and at one with it. It is the unnatural fear that generates the unnecessary layers. This fear comes from thought constructs.</p>
                            
                            <p>Us humans are precious, and our very aliveness is a substrate that, if care is not taken, especially in these strange, boisterous times,  can become overrun by weeds. By weeds, I mean thought constructs. </p>
                            
                            <p>These thought constructs are alive too and depend on our aliveness to survive. Us humans are their source of nourishment. This relationship is parasitic.</p>
                            
                            <p>These thought constructs fear because they, like all living things, tend to want to stick around as long as possible. To stick around, they must control us humans. If we saw them for what they were, then they would die.</p>
                            
                            <p>No doubt, death awaits us all. Yet just as the process of life is precious, so too must be the process of natural death. The goal then is to allow what is unnatural to die its unnatural death before our time is up so that the value of the process of our natural death is not covered up by unnecessary layers of unnecessary fear. </p>

                            <p>Nature requires no thought structures to do what it needs to do. Intelligence is not found within thought but vice versa. Intelligence requires no thought whatsoever. Nature's inherently intelligent processes go far beyond the limits of any thinking process.</p>

                            <p>Thought cannot conceive of that from which it is conceived.</p>
                            
                            <p>The structures of thought so easily become prisons within which all sorts of strange things arise. Thought begets thought. The nature of these inbred thoughts is all too often anti-nature and anti-reality.</p>
                            
                            <p>We think we think our thoughts. This is one of thought's safeguards. Give the prisoners a sense of control, and they become docile. We are not in control. We are always enslaved to one master or another. Who we are yoked to depends on our relationship to thought. </p>
                            
                            <p>The little sliver of mind that consists of thought processes is a terrible master. It's an echo chamber that cuts us off from the beauty and simplicity of what is and what we are meant to be. </p>
                            
                            <p>Nature and the processes of nature, indeed, are what brought about this capacity to think. Thought can use this to justify itself. To try and place itself above nature. It thinks, “If nature is so perfect in its processes, then thought must not be bad.” And this is true to a point. Currently, we humans tend to extend past this point. It thinks, “I am the pinnacle of nature, and so my rightful place is as its master.”</p>
                            
                            <p>Thought is a tool. And just like any tool, it can be used for good and bad. Like fire, it can warm us or burn us to a crisp. Unlike fire, thought can do so with intent.</p>

                            <p>Learning to be trusting is a means to becoming trustworthy. Giving is receiving. Giving the benefit of the doubt, and trusting when it's not earned, has a magical way of making people trustworthy through a sort of osmosis. This is a sweet generosity both to ourselves and to others.</p>

                            <p>It's generous to ourselves because it softens our hearts by reducing the energy we give to the fearful ego. Where does this sense of untrustworthiness come from, if not my fears, desires, and memories of past offenses? All these are unstable, and if anything is not worthy of trust, it is that which is unstable.</p>
                            
                            <p>Yet much energy is sucked from me when I stabilize what is unstable and ever-shifting. This story I tell myself and all the emotions generated within it may seem stable due to its pervasive presence, but that is an illusion. It is easy to see how shifty it is when one watches it carefully. </p>
                            
                            <p>If we can let go of these inner vortexes which pull us down and lock up our energy, we will learn that there is a process alive within us that is the essence of trustworthiness. Encountering what is trustworthy within makes it easier and easier to trust those we encounter without. There is a sweet feedback loop in this. </p>
                            
                            <p>As I do this, I learn that what is trustworthy within me has nothing to do with “me.” It is not unique to me and is alive within all. It cannot be possessed, yet its presence is experienced when I trust what is trustworthy within you. Consistently practicing this dissolves what is untrustworthy within and without.</p>

                            <p>When my heart is at peace, my mind is given space to blow, and unsettling thoughts can settle. If I engage the unsettling thoughts by trying to settle them, I add to the agitation. I cannot control my thoughts with more thoughts. </p>

                            <p>Certainly, my thoughts can swirl around each other, but they cannot settle each other. They only stir each other up. The very thought of quieting thought with thought is insane. Any motive to do so is silly. Yet still, I find myself in a state of insane silliness all too often.</p>
                            
                            <p>But if I can sink into my heart, look for my heart's beat within my body, becoming sensitive and attuned to its steady pulsation and the subtle sensations and vibrance within, then my thoughts have no choice but to quiet and calm. </p>
                            
                            <p>I find the most effective method to sink into the heart is to call upon the heart's good buddy-the breath. The breath leads me in, and if I focus long enough on my breath, I will find the pulsation of my heartbeat. Sometimes here, sometimes there, but always somewhere and always near enough. </p>
                            
                            <p>It's an interesting space being present within the body and following the sensations as they arrive. There are no words found here, yet there is communication.</p>
                            
                            <p>This communication holds within it no motive. Its quality is the essence of sincerity and honesty. When my words and thoughts can root themselves into the example provided by my body, what troubles me, inside and out, vanishes. I can then be to the world as my body is to me.</p>

                            <p>Calm and calming water, receptive to the slightest of additions of weight. It ripples, and velvet and silk take notes. A microphone on high gain. All inputs welcomed with the perfect response. No motive, just reception, and expression. </p>

                            <p>Gaze into the water, and it gazes back. See what you will. Its distortions are undistorted by malevolence or flattery. It is sincere without the need for reciprocation.</p>

                            <p>Water refuses no one or thing. Bring your poison and bring your joy. Both are welcome. One washes away, and the other amplifies. Yet it doesn't seek to wash or amplify. It only is what it is.</p>

                            <p>Add fire, it warms the bones and relaxes the stiff and achy muscles and joints. Fibers loosen and open. The skin becomes supple, then wrinkly. The children laugh as they see what they will become. Surrendering sighs release and vibrate the air. The lungs open, and the clinging gunk releases in expelled wads.</p>

                            <p>Quiet and still in the dim blue morning. Gray fog laying light and thin upon the meadow's yellow grass. Feeling the soft sway of the blades in the gentle breeze. Gazing into the crystal spheres of dew clinging to the pointed ends of the grass, which hold them up as precious offerings.</p>

                            <p>Suddenly a flock of geese tracing their favorite letter breaks over the dark treeline, honking and calling. The sound pierces and vibrates the soul. The ears drink it in. The eyes close in joyful relishing.</p>

                            <p>The damp and sweet smell of soggy earth, grass, and tree swirl inside, dancing with the wild calls of the geese. Intoxicating symphony of sense.</p>

                            <p>The calm, almost chilly breeze, more like a cool breath, caresses the hairs of the arms. Thousands of mounds tighten around these blades of grass growing from the field of skin. Inside this precious clothing, electrical sensation. </p>

                            <p>A smile. A disappearance. A sweet surrendering. </p>

                            <p>The eyes open, each lid gently peeling away from one another, the slow parting of lover's lips. </p>

                            <p>There. On the edge, where forest and meadow greet one another, a deer slowly emerges, looking this way and that—a timid revelation on high alert for any movement and sound. </p>

                            <p>Eyes meeting. More electricity, this vibrating joy turns up a few more notches. The deer remains. Our presence welcomes one another—an embracing. </p>

                            <p>Success, failure, hope, fear—these are addictions of the mind. They push, pull, prod, and direct attention and action. We trample what is precious as we chase after and run away from these phantoms and mirages—circular madness. </p>

                            <p>From where do these emotions and ideas arise? A culture that ingrains into us what it believes is right. What is at the root of culture? “Cult.” </p>

                            <p>All cults are ideologies, and ideologies have built within them their protections. Success, failure, hope, and fear are the products of these protections. But what is protected?</p>

                            <p>All that's protected is the mind virus that is ideology. Look around and see where ideology has gotten us. The world is afire with ideology, and it is burning in reality. </p>

                            <p>Yet what is it that ideology depends upon? Oh, wait. Don't look there. The one who looks may be cast out and rejected, for that one may begin to ask essential questions. Within the light, the shadow cannot exist.</p>

                            <p>We believe what we believe because we believe it gives us comfort. Then all the beliefs die with the body. Yet something remains. What remains was here before “me,” will be here after “me,”  and is right here within, right now, still and quiet, unconcerned, yet always ready. </p>

                            <p>When we place our trust in what is unstable, in the ripples on the surface of our experience, we lose our neutrality. </p>

                            <p>Colors, sound, taste, thought, emotion - these, on their own, left to themselves, are not bad. When we choose to place all our sense of life into them, we lose the essence of the life that flows within.</p>

                            <p>Sweet neutrality and alert readiness are qualities of our natural state. We keep these qualities by allowing what enters into our experiencing to flow through without clinging. It is the clinging that dirties up our natural state. Now when some sensory experience enters our field of experiencing, it must pass through a filmy layer. </p>

                            <p>If we cling long enough, we grow numb to primordial experiencing. Tastes lose their flavor, laughter is less joyful, colors dull, we get caught within perpetual thought-emotion loops, the mind weakens, and the heart hardens into stone. </p>

                            <p>But it is never too late to clean the inner lens of experiencing. The only action required is a form of inaction. It is a relaxation rather than a tensing. It is a letting go. If we devote ourselves to this, the process will naturally return us to sweet, buoyant neutrality. </p>

                            <p>We, humans, exist within a living matrix. The complexity of this matrix is subtle and intelligent. The intelligence of this process overwhelms any attempt to try and encapsulate it with thought. </p>

                            <p>Thought and its arrogant claims of superiority and authority over the body reflect its ignorance. Thought is a blessing or a curse. It is a blessing when placed in its proper position. It is a curse when placed anywhere other than where it is meant to be. The horse and the cart have a natural arrangement that works. </p>

                            <p>When I am full of thought, desires, and a sense of identity rooted in the imbalance of the social fabric I grew up within, then the body's intelligence becomes blotted out. I have turned my back to the sun and live within shadow. </p>

                            <p>Thought is loud. The body's intelligence is quiet and still even in the complexity of its ever-moving processes. This intelligence is not forceful. It will allow what is noisy to enter in and obscure it. </p>

                            <p>Yet stillness and quiet are always present. It is upon these qualities that all occur. Noise cannot kill what it depends upon to live—what a beautiful fail-safe. </p>

                            <p>When two humans full of noise interact, it is like the clashing of stones against one another. The result is more noise and reinforcement of that which ought to be released.  </p>

                            <p>Yet stillness remains untouched by the noise, waiting patiently. It has all the time in the world. </p>

                            <p>A still mind is a blessing to one's self and the circumstance within which that mind resides. </p>

                            <p>Interestingly, stillness generates ripples in the environment. Nothing occurs within a vacuum. There is always contact. The question is: What is the quality of that contact?</p>

                            <p>When a boisterous force makes contact with another, there is no resolution. Only a louder, more violent situation arises. Anger, destruction, and selfishness beget more of the same when they meet. It's biology. It's physics. It's reality. </p>

                            <p>But what occurs if these forces contact stillness, where nothing is pushing back against them? Resolution is the only outcome. </p>

                            <p>Stillness begets stillness.</p>

                            <p>In stillness, understanding comes to the surface. We see that the cloud of fury was seeded by the fundamental human need to be seen and understood. With understanding comes healing. </p>

                            <p>To be the space within which another can find what they yearn for is to discover and experience one's precious, essential nature. </p>

                            <p>Being the space for another may very well be the best means of being the space for oneself. </p>

                            <p>When I sit to write these, the words get locked up inside when I enslave them to the task of getting approval. The words will not flow. They get captured by this desire. Squeezing them out tends to produce the opposite effect that the desire seeks. This is a blessing. </p>

                            <p>I am not profound in my thinking. What is profound has nothing at all to do with this sense of “me,” though the process that generates all the “mes” walking, talking, and thinking in this world is quite profound. </p>

                            <p>This sense of “me,” with all its ticks, quirks, itchiness, and agitation, is the matter that fills my cup. It blocks out what is. It blocks true peace. </p>

                            <p>The peace found within this hard, brick-like material of “me” is false and momentary. It is momentary because it requires specific alignments of what is out of my control. Hence its fleeting nature. Yet so many of my actions are attempts to control the uncontrollable.</p>

                            <p>What is uncontrollable is precisely that. Controlling the uncontrollable is like trying to remove wetness from water - it is an insane proposition. </p>

                            <p>Yet there is a locus of control. It is not externally bound but internally alive. </p>

                            <p>This locus is outside the brick house of this sense of “me.” This locus is wild, essential, untouched, uncaged, always present, and always vital. </p>

                            <p>Right now, there is an unnecessary layer between this precious locus and the external, uncontrollable reality. To bring this locus of control into contact with the uncontrollable is like giving water to the thirsty.</p>

                            <p>A fairy tale tells how the brick house keeps out the Big Bad Wolf, keeping the vulnerable little piggies safe. </p>

                            <p>Perhaps this is a twisted perspective. Perhaps this is perfectly inverted. Perhaps a nice piggy dinner for the Big Bad Wolf is the perfect medicine for true healing. </p>

                            <p>We all desire to be a nourishing presence within our circumstances because we all desire happiness. Being a nourishing presence, internally and externally, brings about happiness. As we sink to the low places, happiness bubbles up. </p>

                            <p>This happiness is soft and gentle. It doesn't cling to anything. This is why it is happy. It is independent of circumstance because there is nothing to resist the circumstance. </p>

                            <p>Without this resistance to what is, there is energy to resolve circumstances, if possible. If immediate resolution is not possible, there is energy to accept the circumstance and allow it to be. This acceptance is the action of no action. It acts by not adding more waves to a turbulent circumstance. This, too, brings about resolution in time. </p>

                            <p>The only effort necessary to experience and be this happiness is to stop all unnecessary efforts. Subtraction, not addition, is the key. </p>

                            <p>What is truly needed is already present.</p>

                            <p>What is it within that was never born? It is not the body, obviously. It surely is not this sense of identity that lives in my head, a product of culture. It is not the process of thought, for thoughts are born and die quite often within spans of seconds or less.</p>

                            <p>There is something within that is fulfilled, that is selfless. Fulfillment and selflessness go hand in hand. These are qualities that arise from contact with what is eternal within us.</p>

                            <p>My sense of unfulfillment comes from trying to secure what cannot be secured. In this state, I become consumed by agitation. I contract from the world. The experience of life itself becomes one of scarcity.</p>

                            <p>From those sweet states of fulfillment, I expand into the world, meeting it exactly where it is, seeing it clearly and what I share in that meeting is fulfilling. </p>

                            <p>If I feel unfulfilled, the best way to cure this is stillness. Other actions inspired by the state of unfulfillment leave wreckage in their wake. </p>

                            <p>Fulfillment is not earned. It is already present within. It is a gift. The task is simply to learn how to accept what has been given.</p>

                            <p>The Great Mother - that from which all is born; a spaciousness that is the essence of vitality. A potency of potential. </p>

                            <p>Nothing that is is disconnected from this. Even in the sense of disconnection, there is connectivity. It is always present. It is all there is. </p>

                            <p>We can use it any way we want, yet there is a path. </p>

                            <p>Even if one feels they have fallen off the path, where could one possibly fall? Any consequences that arise from one's traversing are only natural and are indications of the nature of the path itself. </p>

                            <p>Because it is so broad and spacious, and we can use it however we want, the path appears to become narrower and narrower. This narrowing path is a revelation of quality.</p>

                            <p>There was never any manual. Every mistake carries with it success. Only by trial and error have we gotten this far.</p>

                            <p>Each life is a means of revealing the path. The path reveals itself, whether life is lived on or off the path.</p>

                            <p>Even so, better to do one's best to journey along the path: what better way to honor all those who came before us?</p>

                            <p>Sweet neutrality. Full acceptance, of what enters within one's experience and circumstance.</p>

                            <p>Fully open eyes to see. Eyes not blinded by planks. Compassionate eyes. Eyes that are adept at seeing to the heart of the matter.</p>

                            <p>An open, clear heart. One that responds and puts our thinking to necessary tasks. </p>

                            <p>The heart is the sacred chamber from which true communication arises. The voice that speaks to what has entered emerges for all ears to hear, even the ones attached  to the same body as the vocal cords. </p>

                            <p>With a clear heart, there are no longer saints, no longer sinners. It's a position of responsiveness and responsibility. Not one of judgment. There is praise, but never condemnation. </p>

                            <p>This responsiveness occurs without mental initiation. This responsiveness initiates proper movement in body and mind and spirit. </p>

                            <p>This responsiveness has at its center stillness. Thus it always moves a situation towards resolution. </p>

                            <p>Mostly nothing is added, unless that addition is one that ultimately leads to subtraction. A strategic position, yet without motivation.</p>

                            <p>There is always more to subtract, than there is to add.</p>

                            <p>This position of neutrality leaves one untouchable and unconsumed, yet fully immersed.</p>

                            <p>One is like a duck floating and swimming and diving in water. Even when fully submerged one remains dry. </p>

                            <p>I look back and see a sort of subtle devastation. </p>

                            <p>My path through life has been driven by boisterous, ever hungrier desires. Desires for recognition have welcomed in envy, greed, and lust. Desires for beauty and possessions have welcomed in vanity and slothfulness. </p>

                            <p>I have chased the unattainable and my body and its pain and my mind with its quirky patterns testify to the results of such a chase.</p>

                            <p>Yet it is not too late. </p>

                            <p>There is time. </p>

                            <p>There is no quick fix scheme to this process of healing. Desiring one is only another mind form seeking for a result. </p>

                            <p>No, the resolution is simplicity. </p>

                            <p>It's more of a divestment than an investment. Yet, divesting from the investments of what is valueless is an investment into what is truly valuable. </p>

                            <p>It's a movement towards simplicity, gently. </p>

                            <p>It is observation and stillness. </p>

                            <p>Allowing the dust to settle and clarity to arise. </p>

                            <p>It is an act of trust and faith in the process within which I am.</p>

                            <p>It is a tending to my garden. But instead of me planting, it's more so a matter of my uprooting what I've planted in order to make room for what would and could grow.</p>

                            <p>In the space created, the seeds of character are sown and nurtured. </p>

                            <p>Experience requires no words. Experience comes through a willingness to be abandoned within the wild moment and to do what the moment and circumstance requires. Nothing more, nothing less. And if more or less, then we experience the waste or the poverty. </p>
                            <p>Experience cannot be possessed. That which believes it possesses experience will pass away in time. That which desires possession is the cage and we are the ones possessed. </p>
                            <p>The one who is experienced does not cling to the experience, but rather has built up enough real experience to trust in the underlying process of experience. That what needs to be known will arise when it needs to be known. And if what needs to be known is not available to arise, then that in and of itself is another experience that is allowed to be experienced and pass through. </p>
                            <p>Experiences pass through us. The more we allow this to occur, the lighter we become. We learn that not much is needed to travel, and what is truly needed is weightless. </p>
                            <p>It is when we cling to the knowledge of our experiences, and worse so when we cling to knowledge unrooted from experience, that we become heavy and rigid. Here is where rigor mortis of the spirit begins to set in. </p>
                            <p>True experience cannot be possessed. True experience can only move through us. If we allow it to do so, we will be revealed. </p>

                            <p>Balance in between. We live in this space between the names and the unnamed. We are the originators of the named, but we ourselves originate from the unnamed. The named is born out of us, yet we are born out of that which is beyond words. We share with this Source the capacity for creation. </p>
                            <p>Yet this power comes with risk. The risk is disconnection from the nature of the Source, from the its subtle wonder. </p>
                            <p>Our ability to name is also an ability to cage ourselves. This encagement is agitating to our spirit, for the spirit's nature is uncontainable.</p>
                            <p>Our words, concepts, and ideas, and our identification with these, is like the hand that tries to grasp water. The water will not cooperate, and even that which does seem to cling to the hand is lost to evaporation. The being that is lost within the named will be frustrated by this. The one who is not lost sees it as it is. Mysterious, wondrous.</p>
                            <p>It is best to be rooted in that which is nameless. What is nameless is bountiful and ever-present. What is named is quick to become idolized yet what is contained within the name is empty space. </p>
                            <p>This is only a problem when we aren't used to being rooted in the bounty that is emptiness. </p>

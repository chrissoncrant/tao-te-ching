                            <p>We, humans, exist within a living matrix. The complexity of this matrix is subtle and intelligent. The intelligence of this process overwhelms any attempt to try and encapsulate it with thought. </p>

                            <p>Thought and its arrogant claims of superiority and authority over the body reflect its ignorance. Thought is a blessing or a curse. It is a blessing when placed in its proper position. It is a curse when placed anywhere other than where it is meant to be. The horse and the cart have a natural arrangement that works. </p>

                            <p>When I am full of thought, desires, and a sense of identity rooted in the imbalance of the social fabric I grew up within, then the body's intelligence becomes blotted out. I have turned my back to the sun and live within shadow. </p>

                            <p>Thought is loud. The body's intelligence is quiet and still even in the complexity of its ever-moving processes. This intelligence is not forceful. It will allow what is noisy to enter in and obscure it. </p>

                            <p>Yet stillness and quiet are always present. It is upon these qualities that all occur. Noise cannot kill what it depends upon to live—what a beautiful fail-safe. </p>

                            <p>When two humans full of noise interact, it is like the clashing of stones against one another. The result is more noise and reinforcement of that which ought to be released.  </p>

                            <p>Yet stillness remains untouched by the noise, waiting patiently. It has all the time in the world. </p>

                            <p>A still mind is a blessing to one's self and the circumstance within which that mind resides. </p>

                            <p>Interestingly, stillness generates ripples in the environment. Nothing occurs within a vacuum. There is always contact. The question is: What is the quality of that contact?</p>

                            <p>When a boisterous force makes contact with another, there is no resolution. Only a louder, more violent situation arises. Anger, destruction, and selfishness beget more of the same when they meet. It's biology. It's physics. It's reality. </p>

                            <p>But what occurs if these forces contact stillness, where nothing is pushing back against them? Resolution is the only outcome. </p>

                            <p>Stillness begets stillness.</p>

                            <p>In stillness, understanding comes to the surface. We see that the cloud of fury was seeded by the fundamental human need to be seen and understood. With understanding comes healing. </p>

                            <p>To be the space within which another can find what they yearn for is to discover and experience one's precious, essential nature. </p>

                            <p>Being the space for another may very well be the best means of being the space for oneself. </p>

                        <div class="writing-container">
                            <p>When I sit to write these, the words get locked up inside when I enslave them to the task of getting approval. The words will not flow. They get captured by this desire. Squeezing them out tends to produce the opposite effect that the desire seeks. This is a blessing. </p>

                            <p>I am not profound in my thinking. What is profound has nothing at all to do with this sense of “me,” though the process that generates all the “mes” walking, talking, and thinking in this world is quite profound. </p>

                            <p>This sense of “me,” with all its ticks, quirks, itchiness, and agitation, is the matter that fills my cup. It blocks out what is. It blocks true peace. </p>

                            <p>The peace found within this hard, brick-like material of “me” is false and momentary. It is momentary because it requires specific alignments of what is out of my control. Hence its fleeting nature. Yet so many of my actions are attempts to control the uncontrollable.</p>

                            <p>What is uncontrollable is precisely that. Controlling the uncontrollable is like trying to remove wetness from water - it is an insane proposition. </p>

                            <p>Yet there is a locus of control. It is not externally bound but internally alive. </p>

                            <p>This locus is outside the brick house of this sense of “me.” This locus is wild, essential, untouched, uncaged, always present, and always vital. </p>

                            <p>Right now, there is an unnecessary layer between this precious locus and the external, uncontrollable reality. To bring this locus of control into contact with the uncontrollable is like giving water to the thirsty.</p>

                            <p>A fairy tale tells how the brick house keeps out the Big Bad Wolf, keeping the vulnerable little piggies safe. </p>

                            <p>Perhaps this is a twisted perspective. Perhaps this is perfectly inverted. Perhaps a nice piggy dinner for the Big Bad Wolf is the perfect medicine for true healing. </p>

                            <p>We all desire to be a nourishing presence within our circumstances because we all desire happiness. Being a nourishing presence, internally and externally, brings about happiness. As we sink to the low places, happiness bubbles up. </p>

                            <p>This happiness is soft and gentle. It doesn't cling to anything. This is why it is happy. It is independent of circumstance because there is nothing to resist the circumstance. </p>

                            <p>Without this resistance to what is, there is energy to resolve circumstances, if possible. If immediate resolution is not possible, there is energy to accept the circumstance and allow it to be. This acceptance is the action of no action. It acts by not adding more waves to a turbulent circumstance. This, too, brings about resolution in time. </p>

                            <p>The only effort necessary to experience and be this happiness is to stop all unnecessary efforts. Subtraction, not addition, is the key. </p>

                            <p>What is truly needed is already present.</p>

                            <p>What is it within that was never born? It is not the body, obviously. It surely is not this sense of identity that lives in my head, a product of culture. It is not the process of thought, for thoughts are born and die quite often within spans of seconds or less.</p>

                            <p>There is something within that is fulfilled, that is selfless. Fulfillment and selflessness go hand in hand. These are qualities that arise from contact with what is eternal within us.</p>

                            <p>My sense of unfulfillment comes from trying to secure what cannot be secured. In this state, I become consumed by agitation. I contract from the world. The experience of life itself becomes one of scarcity.</p>

                            <p>From those sweet states of fulfillment, I expand into the world, meeting it exactly where it is, seeing it clearly and what I share in that meeting is fulfilling. </p>

                            <p>If I feel unfulfilled, the best way to cure this is stillness. Other actions inspired by the state of unfulfillment leave wreckage in their wake. </p>

                            <p>Fulfillment is not earned. It is already present within. It is a gift. The task is simply to learn how to accept what has been given.</p>

                            <p>The Great Mother - that from which all is born; a spaciousness that is the essence of vitality. A potency of potential. </p>

                            <p>Nothing that is is disconnected from this. Even in the sense of disconnection, there is connectivity. It is always present. It is all there is. </p>

                            <p>We can use it any way we want, yet there is a path. </p>

                            <p>Even if one feels they have fallen off the path, where could one possibly fall? Any consequences that arise from one's traversing are only natural and are indications of the nature of the path itself. </p>

                            <p>Because it is so broad and spacious, and we can use it however we want, the path appears to become narrower and narrower. This narrowing path is a revelation of quality.</p>

                            <p>There was never any manual. Every mistake carries with it success. Only by trial and error have we gotten this far.</p>

                            <p>Each life is a means of revealing the path. The path reveals itself, whether life is lived on or off the path.</p>

                            <p>Even so, better to do one's best to journey along the path: what better way to honor all those who came before us?</p>

                            <p>Sweet neutrality. Full acceptance, of what enters within one's experience and circumstance.</p>

                            <p>Fully open eyes to see. Eyes not blinded by planks. Compassionate eyes. Eyes that are adept at seeing to the heart of the matter.</p>

                            <p>An open, clear heart. One that responds and puts our thinking to necessary tasks. </p>

                            <p>The heart is the sacred chamber from which true communication arises. The voice that speaks to what has entered emerges for all ears to hear, even the ones attached  to the same body as the vocal cords. </p>

                            <p>With a clear heart, there are no longer saints, no longer sinners. It's a position of responsiveness and responsibility. Not one of judgment. There is praise, but never condemnation. </p>

                            <p>This responsiveness occurs without mental initiation. This responsiveness initiates proper movement in body and mind and spirit. </p>

                            <p>This responsiveness has at its center stillness. Thus it always moves a situation towards resolution. </p>

                            <p>Mostly nothing is added, unless that addition is one that ultimately leads to subtraction. A strategic position, yet without motivation.</p>

                            <p>There is always more to subtract, than there is to add.</p>

                            <p>This position of neutrality leaves one untouchable and unconsumed, yet fully immersed.</p>

                            <p>One is like a duck floating and swimming and diving in water. Even when fully submerged one remains dry. </p>

                            <p>I look back and see a sort of subtle devastation. </p>

                            <p>My path through life has been driven by boisterous, ever hungrier desires. Desires for recognition have welcomed in envy, greed, and lust. Desires for beauty and possessions have welcomed in vanity and slothfulness. </p>

                            <p>I have chased the unattainable and my body and its pain and my mind with its quirky patterns testify to the results of such a chase.</p>

                            <p>Yet it is not too late. </p>

                            <p>There is time. </p>

                            <p>There is no quick fix scheme to this process of healing. Desiring one is only another mind form seeking for a result. </p>

                            <p>No, the resolution is simplicity. </p>

                            <p>It's more of a divestment than an investment. Yet, divesting from the investments of what is valueless is an investment into what is truly valuable. </p>

                            <p>It's a movement towards simplicity, gently. </p>

                            <p>It is observation and stillness. </p>

                            <p>Allowing the dust to settle and clarity to arise. </p>

                            <p>It is an act of trust and faith in the process within which I am.</p>

                            <p>It is a tending to my garden. But instead of me planting, it's more so a matter of my uprooting what I've planted in order to make room for what would and could grow.</p>

                            <p>In the space created, the seeds of character are sown and nurtured. </p>

                            <p>The best teacher is experience. The next best teacher is the one we observe, the one who does without explaining. We observe, then some process beyond our sense of “I” recognizes. </p>
                            <p>Experience requires no words. Experience comes through a willingness to be abandoned within the wild moment and to do what the moment and circumstance requires. Nothing more, nothing less. And if more or less, then we experience the waste or the poverty. </p>
                            <p>Experience cannot be possessed. That which believes it possesses experience will pass away in time. That which desires possession is the cage and we are the ones possessed. </p>
                            <p>The one who is experienced does not cling to the experience, but rather has built up enough real experience to trust in the underlying process of experience. That what needs to be known will arise when it needs to be known. And if what needs to be known is not available to arise, then that in and of itself is another experience that is allowed to be experienced and pass through. </p>
                            <p>Experiences pass through us. The more we allow this to occur, the lighter we become. We learn that not much is needed to travel, and what is truly needed is weightless. </p>
                            <p>It is when we cling to the knowledge of our experiences, and worse so when we cling to knowledge unrooted from experience, that we become heavy and rigid. Here is where rigor mortis of the spirit begins to set in. </p>
                            <p>True experience cannot be possessed. True experience can only move through us. If we allow it to do so, we will be revealed. </p>

                            <p>Balance in between. We live in this space between the names and the unnamed. We are the originators of the named, but we ourselves originate from the unnamed. The named is born out of us, yet we are born out of that which is beyond words. We share with this Source the capacity for creation. </p>
                            <p>Yet this power comes with risk. The risk is disconnection from the nature of the Source, from the its subtle wonder. </p>
                            <p>Our ability to name is also an ability to cage ourselves. This encagement is agitating to our spirit, for the spirit's nature is uncontainable.</p>
                            <p>Our words, concepts, and ideas, and our identification with these, is like the hand that tries to grasp water. The water will not cooperate, and even that which does seem to cling to the hand is lost to evaporation. The being that is lost within the named will be frustrated by this. The one who is not lost sees it as it is. Mysterious, wondrous.</p>
                            <p>It is best to be rooted in that which is nameless. What is nameless is bountiful and ever-present. What is named is quick to become idolized yet what is contained within the name is empty space. </p>
                            <p>This is only a problem when we aren't used to being rooted in the bounty that is emptiness. </p>
